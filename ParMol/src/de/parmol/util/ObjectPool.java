/**
 * This class represents a pool for objects that can be reused. If you allocate millions of small objects and throw them away very soon it improves performance
 * (especially in multithreaded programms) if you reuse objects and just copy the values. This class provides the basic functionality.
 * You can create more than one pool in an object of this class, e.g. if you have objects of the same class but with different sizes. So the objects need to be grouped
 * according to their sizes.
